## 🙌 Acknowledgements

The design is inspired by a website created in 2020 with the premise that it would self-destruct if nobody posted on it in a 24-hour period. I loved the idea of the project and even more the design choice. it elactually self destructed in couple years ago, but it created roots :) ♡
